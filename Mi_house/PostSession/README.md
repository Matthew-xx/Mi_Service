## Configuration

## Dependencies

Micro services depend on service discovery. The default is multicast DNS, a zeroconf system.

In the event you need a resilient multi-host setup we recommend etcd.

```
# install etcd
brew install etcd

# run etcd
etcd
```

## Usage

A Makefile is included for convenience

Build the binary

```
make build
```

Run the service
```
./PostSession-srv
```

Build a docker image
```
make docker
```
